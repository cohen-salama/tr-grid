# TR-GRID

## description

TR-GRID is an interactive rhythm composer based on the functionality of old Roland drum machines. TR-GRID generates its user interface by putting together 4 grids of 16 slots, each of them representing a 16th note inside a cyclic 4/4 measure. Each grid allows the user to design a pattern that corresponds to the instrument that's indicated next to it. The sounds on this first version of TR-GRID are basic samples from a Roland TR-909.

The drum beat generated by TR-GRID loops constantly until stopped and is responsive to live changes in the user's pattern design. It also responds to tempo or volume changes and, in both cases, it does so with one musical measure of delay. 

After pressing play, the user can stop TR-GRID from looping, then press play again or decide to clear the grid to begin with the design of a new pattern.

The functionality of this app is achieved by utilizing a Web Audio Api context to create some audio buffers. These buffers are meant to be played by a loop function that's triggered by the play button and iterates over a 16 element (or 16 "beats") array. This function sets a timeout interval relative to the occurence of each of the 16 notes inside a measure in order to fire this 16 iterations equally spaced in time. In each iteration, the loop will be playing either the corresponding sound or nothing by following the content of the mentioned 16 element beats array that's kept in state and is generated by the user's interaction with the slots. The app uses the componentDidUpdate lifecycle method to decide whether to continue or to stop playing this sequence in an eternal loop.
